Question:

From the 2011 South African Junior Olympiad:

Several people line up in single file.
A solitary latecomer wishes to join the queue.
Prove that it is always possible for them to join the line somewhere
so that the number of men in front of them is equal to the number of women behind them.

Warning:

I use position as a synonym for index, where indices start from 0.
This implies that position n has n positions before it.

Notation:

wa = woman after him
was = (all) the woman after him
mb = man before him
mbs = (all) the man before him
ws = (all) the woman
ms = (all) the man 

#xs stands for the number of elements of xs

Proposition:

The position p for the latecomer to join is the one with #ws before it.

Proof:

If mbs is empty, then was is also empty and #mbs == #was

If mbs is not empty, then there exists a function from was to mbs.

The proof then follows from the lemma below.

Lemma:
The function from the proposition above is a bijection between was and mbs.

Proof(by contradiction):

Assume that the function is not injective.
This implies that there are two wa's mapped on one mb.
In that case #ws would be too large.

Assume that the injection is not surjective.
In that case the position is one with more than #ws positions before it.
